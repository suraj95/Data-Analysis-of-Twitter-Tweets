# Data-Analysis-of-Twitter-Tweets

![alt text](./images/dashboard.png)

This project introduces AFrame, a new scalable data analysis package powered by a Big Data management system that extends the data scientist's familiar DataFrame operations to efficiently operate on managed data at scale. The first step was collecting data from Twitter using Twitterâ€™s OAuth API and hashtags to specifically target certain categories. The second step was anaylyzing the tweets for insights using AFrames, which is implemented as a layer on top of Apache AsterixDB, transparently scaling out the execution of DataFrame operations and machine learning model invocation through a parallel, shared-nothing big data management system.
