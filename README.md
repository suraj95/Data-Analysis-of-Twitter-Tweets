Data Analysis of Twitter Tweets Using AsterixDB

This project introduces AFrame, a new scalable data analysis package powered by a Big Data management system that extends the data scientistsâ€™
familiar DataFrame operations to efficiently operate on managed data at scale. AFrame is implemented as a layer on top of Apache 
AsterixDB, transparently scaling out the execution of DataFrame operations and machine learning model invocation through a
parallel, shared-nothing big data management system.
